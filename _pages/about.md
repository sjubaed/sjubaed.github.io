About Me
======
I am currently a Senior Data and Policy Analyst at [Poverty Solutions](https://poverty.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan. Earlier, I was a Research Associate at Yale School of Management for Professor Rodrigo Canales through [Innovations for Poverty Action](http://www.poverty-action.org/). Before switching over to all things data, I was an Adjunct Lecturer at CUNY Hunter College's [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](http://math.hunter.cuny.edu/) for over six years.
