Welcome to my personal site. I am currently a Senior Data and Policy Analyst at [Poverty Solutions](https://poverty.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan. Earlier, I was a Research Associate at Yale School of Management for Professor Rodrigo Canales through [Innovations for Poverty Action](http://www.poverty-action.org/).

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
